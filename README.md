## Collborative 3D Model Generation 
In a collaborative environment of 3D modellers you should [fork the repository `Blender Models`](https://github.com/2can0-records/Blender-Models) and add your own models to your repository. 
After adding your own 3D blender models you can create a pull request for the repository [`Blender Models`](https://github.com/2can0-records/Blender-Models). 
By this approach the 3D Blender community can build on joint repository of Blender models.
